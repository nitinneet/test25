# Hardware In Loop Tests

Current testing workflow for HIL testing is using Spirent test center to emulate eNodeB, UE and Network host to run scale and Performance tests. We cover
gateway-only tests.
HIL tests can be run with different gateway. However for now the automated runs are using physical [Protectli](https://protectli.com/vault-4-port) box.

## Lab Setup

Spirent test emulation hardware is hosted in FB lab emulating eNODEB, UE and traffic host elements. gateway are also hosted in same lab. All tests are
executed in worker node in FB lab. Reports and logs are pushed out to aws S3 for debug and analysis.

### Run tests

To setup HIL worker follow [instruction](https://github.com/fbcinternal/ens_magma/tree/master/spirent_automation)
Current Test categories supported are:

1. Sanity (nightly run time - 30 minutes) update badge with latest results on magma main README
1. Performance (nightly run time - 12hrs)
1. Feature tests at scale - (nightly run time - 6 hrs)
1. Availability - Every day for 12hrs period

### HIL SANITY TEST CASES

1. Verify 12 eNodeBs can connect to a Magma Access Gateway
1. Verify 200 UEs at 5 UE/sec can connect to a Magma Access Gateway
1. Verify 400 UEs at 5 UE/sec can connect to a Magma Access Gateway
1. Verify 600 UEs at 5 UE/sec can connect to a Magma Access Gateway
1. Verify 200 UEs across 12 eNodeBs with 2M data per UE
1. Verify 400 UEs across 12 eNodeBs with 500k data per UE
1. Verify 600 UEs across 12 eNodeBs with 500k data per UE
1. Verify 30 UEs across 12 eNodeBs with 500K data changing state from active-idle-active-idle
1. Verify APN 10 correction mapping with 50 UEs
1. Verify PLMN Restriction for 50 valid UEs and 50 invalid UEs

### Dashboard

All test suite results and daily runs are available to compare on [dashboard](http://automation.fbmagma.ninja/) admin/test1234
We can retrieve log and grafana metrics for each run by clicking on test run result table.

### Notification

All test suite run send notification to slack channel which is used as alerting mechanism.
please join slack [chennal](https://magmacore.slack.com/archives/C02164DSGPM) for regular update
